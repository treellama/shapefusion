An editor for Marathon II, Marathon Infinity and AlephOne Shapes files

Copyright 2000-2007 Tito Dal Canton and Etienne Samson


What is ShapeFusion?
--------------------
ShapeFusion is a scenario editor for the Bungie games "Marathon II: Durandal" and "Marathon Infinity".
It's useful also for the AlephOne engine, the Open Source evolution of the original games (I consider
it part of the AlephOne effort, actually). A Marathon scenario is made of several files; ShapeFusion
is devoted to editing the "Shapes" file, which stores most of the game graphics and animation data.
It's *not* a tool for editing maps. In case you ever used Bungie tools for editing Marathon scenarios,
it's enough to say that ShapeFusion is meant as a replacement for Anvil, or better for its Shapes
editor. Anvil has always been a buggy, incomplete, closed-source and Mac-only editor: I hope things
will be better with ShapeFusion.

As for the license, ShapeFusion is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. For more information see the COPYING file that comes with ShapeFusion.

History
-------
ShapeFusion was born in 2000 as a MacOS Classic application. Working releases were produced, but
then I moved to other projects and the development ended while ShapeFusion was still far from being
a complete editor.

With the death of the Classic platform and the spread of AlephOne on different operating systems
I became more and more attracted by the idea of porting ShapeFusion to other systems too. This
couldn't be done easily with the original MacOS code, so eventually I started to rewrite everything
using the portable wxWidgets toolkit. I also had the opportunity to rework the user interface, since
I never liked the Anvil approach that I was trying to follow in the original ShapeFusion.
Etienne joined the project at this stage.

The new editor is not yet complete, but it's a great improvement at least on the technical side
(stability, code organization, portability). Adding new features and fixing existing ones will be
much easier with respect to the old version.

Supported platforms
-------------------
The new ShapeFusion is being developed and constantly tested both on Linux and MacOS X. Thanks to
wxWidgets it should compile and work also on Windows and maybe other systems, but I've never tried it.
ShapeFusion could *in theory* compile and work also on MacOS Classic, but we have no plans on this side.
If you build ShapeFusion on systems different from Linux and MacOS X, please let us know (screenshots
are appreciated!).

Building
--------
You'll need wxWidgets (at least version 2.6.1) to compile ShapeFusion.

On Linux systems you can test the presence of wxWidgets by running the command 'wx-config --version'.
If that command is available and gives you the right version, everything should work; otherwise install
wxWidgets following your Linux distribution rules. To compile ShapeFusion, just do a 'make' inside the
source directory. When compilation is complete, simply run the 'shapefusion' executable (you can put it
anywhere in your PATH).

On MacOS X you should be able to use the provided Xcode project in the osx-build directory. You'll
need both the MacOS X developer tools and wxWidgets. Note that we are releasing MacOS X binary builds
along with each source release: they should work out-of-the-box without the need to install anything
else. In case you're wondering why they are so large in size, it is because they carry the whole
wxWidgets code linked statically.

Overview of the ShapeFusion window
----------------------------------
When you open a Shapes file, the window shows its collection slots on the left. There are always 32
of them. Each slot can be opened revealing two sub-slots, the 8 bit and true color versions. They
represent two independent versions of the same collection: the first will be used if the game is
played on low-color displays, the second is for modern high-color displays (including the OpenGL mode
in AlephOne). Each sub-slot can finally be opened to reveal its real content: bitmaps, color tables,
frames and sequences. The contrast with Anvil is clear. Anvil tries to obfuscate some aspects of the
Shapes file organization, but I feel that this creates a lot of confusion in the user. In my opinion,
it makes more sense to treat Shapes files as they really are: archives of collections. The
ShapeFusion window tries to reflect this idea.

Bitmaps, color tables and frames are displayed as lists of preview thumbnails. Selecting one of them
will pop up an edit panel for that item. Sequences are listed by their name since they can't be
easily represented with thumbnails; however, selecting a sequence will pop up an edit panel like for
other items.

The logic behind ShapeFusion is that each collection is made of four sets of entities: color tables,
bitmaps, frames and sequences. If you follow this order, entities coming after reference entities
coming before: a sequence references a set of frames, a frame references a bitmap, a bitmap naturally
references a color table since it's indexed. So editing a sequence involves picking frames from the
collection frame set, and editing a frame involves selecting a bitmap from the collection bitmap set.
Get it? ;-) Of course you don't have to follow this flow, expecially if you are only adjusting some
settings.

The View menu contains display settings such as thumbnail size. Nothing here affects what's inside the
Shapes file.

Notes
-----
Please be careful when editing your scenario with ShapeFusion. We had no problems so far, but it's
still under development and it may corrupt your Shapes files, so be sure to keep backup copies.
You shouldn't use versions before 0.3, as they are affected by a bug regarding frames minimum light
intensity value. If you think your Shapes got corrupted by ShapeFusion, please let us know what happened.

Object indexes start from 0, not 1. So if you have 12 bitmaps, the first is bitmap 0 (not 1) and the
last is bitmap 11 (not 12).

Bitmaps are exported as Windows bitmap (.bmp) files. They get the color table that is currently used
for viewing, as selected in the View menu. They are also affected by the "show transparent pixels"
option: if it's on, transparent areas will be blue.

When you import a bitmap, ShapeFusion tries to map its colors to the collection color table as best as
it can. However, the algorithm is not perfect. You can help it a lot by converting the bitmap to
indexed before (using PhotoShop or Gimp, for example) so that it contains just colors belonging to the
collection color table.

You can't edit color tables yet. They are just displayed.

In ShapeFusion, a frame can be referenced by many sequences. This may sound strange at first, but in
Shapes file format logic it's perfectly legal and we think it makes sense too. However it can create a
bit of confusion if you forget it. Keep in mind that a famous Anvil bug is based on this very
confusion. But in Anvil it's a bug, in ShapeFusion it's a feature ;-)

You can't open more than one Shapes file at a time. However you can launch more copies of ShapeFusion
and open each file with them. Work on this side is in progress and ShapeFusion will be a multidocument
application soon.

If you open an "original" Shapes file (e.g. from Marathon II) and then save it without touching
anything, it won't probably have exactly the same size. In other words, it won't be exactly the same
file. However I've never been able to tell the difference, apart from looking at the size. The original
engines, AlephOne and ShapeFusion itself seem to behave perfectly with both files. The size mismatch
has probably to do with data structure alignments: ShapeFusion ignores alignments when writing files,
it just packs structure after structure and so produces generally smaller files.

Shapes files are known to rarely contain strange data, like negative sequence ticks_per_frame. Maybe
this comes from some broken Shapes editor, but it could be just Anvil. ShapeFusion doesn't handle this
invalid data very well, but we plan to implement some consistency checks in the future.
