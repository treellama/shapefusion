// Shapes
// Shapes class representing what's inside a Marathon shapes file.
// Note that, for keeping things simple and providing compatibility,
// the class doesn't store everything using the original on-disk format.
// For example, flags are expanded to bool fields and fixed point values
// are converted to floats. Every bitmap is converted to a simple block
// of width*height pixels, regardless of its compression and pixel order.
// Conversions take place only when actually loading and writing files.
